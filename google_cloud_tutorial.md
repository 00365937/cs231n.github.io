For the class project and assignments, we offer an option to use Google Compute Engine for developing and testing your 
implementations. This tutorial lists the necessary steps of working on the assignments using Google Cloud. 
For each assignment, we will provide you with an image containing the starter code and all dependencies that you need to 
complete the assignment. This tutorial goes through how to set up your own Google Compute Engine (GCE) instance with the 
provided images for the assignments. **We do not currently distribute Google Cloud credits to CS231N students but you 
are welcome to use this snapshot on your own budget.**

First, if you don't have a Google Cloud account already, create one by going to the https://cloud.google.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=2015-q2-cloud-na-gcp-skws-freetrial-en&gclid=CP2e4PPpiNMCFU9bfgodGHsA1A -automatic!, and clicking on the blue “TRY IT FREE” button. If you are not logged into gmail, you will see a page that 
looks like the one below. Sign into your gmail account or create a new one if you do not already have an account.
